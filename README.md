# EBurNiFication
EBNF stuff (so nobody can expect anything from it)

## The big picture

Goals:
* Parse a syntax in EBNF form
* Allow programmatic form
* Use the defined syntax to parse documents

This is not:
* A grammatical parser, it just handles syntax.
* A language generator or anything else.

## Current status

Nothing to show for now. I'm working on it.
